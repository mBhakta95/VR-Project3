### Project Description
- For project 3, I decided to create a space simulator in which the user can learn more about the planets in our solar system individually with real data as well as to have to option to explore the space in a spacecraft. If time allows I would to expand this project even more by adding asteroids and galaxies.
P.D. If anyone wants to check it out, I made a release in GitHub.

### Issues encountered
  - Had to use git to push files in github since one of my files exceeded the 100mb limit.
  - Find the right position for a particle system in the main camera to give a sense of traveling in the space.
